# Kd-Trees

This code implements a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have *x*- and *y*-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a *2d-tree* to support efficient *range search* (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and *nearest-neighbor search* (find a closest point to a query point).
